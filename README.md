# Class4-Machine_Learning-Week26

Hey there, 
For the assignment of this week, 


1 - You are asked to work on mobile price classification which you will predict the price range of mobile phones. Use the link below to see the description of the data and for downloading purposes. For modelling, you can use any model you want, but you need to apply one of the dimensionality reduction techniques you have learned. Compare your results which you did implement reduction with the one you did not. Observe if you have significant difference in the evaluation metrics.

2 - You will use the dataset of Combined cycle power plant. The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. You are expected to predict Net hourly electrical energy output.(EP). 
You should implement a neural network for this prediction. Evaluate your results after implementing neural network. You can use Colab for the assignment. 
* Note: Use MSE(minimum squared error) for the loss function.

After you have done your assignment, you have to upload the links of Colab or Kaggle into Github.

### Good luck
